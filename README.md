# SparkML-Pipeline: Scalable Real-time Data Processing and Predictive Analytics Framework
---

Welcome to the SparkML-Pipeline project repository. This framework is designed to harness the power of Apache Spark and its machine learning library, MLlib, to process large datasets and perform predictive analytics in real-time.

## Project Overview

The SparkML-Pipeline is an end-to-end solution for data-driven organizations looking to leverage big data for actionable insights. This pipeline allows for efficient data transformation from raw, unstructured datasets to structured Spark DataFrames and RDDs, and applies advanced machine learning models for predictive insights.

## Features

- **Scalable Data Processing**: Built on Apache PySpark, the pipeline can handle massive datasets with ease, ensuring that your data processing scales with your data.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilize MLlib for building and deploying predictive models directly within the data processing flow.
- **Real-time Streaming**: With Spark Streaming integration, the pipeline can process live data streams, making it ideal for real-time analytics.
- **Database Persistence**: Seamless persistence to both SQL and NoSQL databases, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- **Structured and Unstructured Data**: Whether your data is in CSVs, JSON, logs, or even image files, our pipeline is equipped to handle it.
- **Data Serialization**: Incorporates efficient data serialization formats like Parquet and Avro for optimal storage and quick retrieval.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apache Spark 3.x
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Java 8 or higher
- SBT (for Scala builds)
- Hadoop (optional, for HDFS support)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SparkML-Pipeline.git
cd SparkML-Pipeline
```

Set up a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To run the pipeline, use the following command:

```bash
spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.0.1 main.py
```

Adjust the command based on your specific Spark setup and dependencies.
